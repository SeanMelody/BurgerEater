## Thank you's

    This app would not have been possible without all of the demos that we have gone over.
    The cat is sleepy demo became the skeleton of this project, thank you to Thomas Smith for instructing!
    Also thank you to Lidsay Chapin who's youtube walkthrough of Heroku deployment, made this possible.
